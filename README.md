# Javascript-Learning

#### Build 5 beautiful real-world projects! In these projects, you will plan and architect your applications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns

#### Master the JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more

#### Learn modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining, and more

#### How JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, reference values, and more.

#### Deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.

#### Deep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. 

#### Deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls. 

#### Learn modern tools that are used by professional web developers: NPM, Parcel (module bundler), Babel, and ES6 modules
